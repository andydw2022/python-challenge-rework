Analysis of Election results
----------------------------
There was a clear winner with Khan gaining 63% of the vote well ahead of the other threewho  were more closely grouped. What is
interesting is that there were no informal votes. Every single vote cast was legitimate.
Also further analysis by county would have been an interesting exercise.
